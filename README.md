# IMDB
It was responsive web page, which uses the opensource API called oMDB from which the movie insights are fetched and shown to the user

And as mentioned i didn't used the Db to create the tables and i have not implemented any schema, But i have designed the API cals and have used ajax to call it from IMDB provided open source service. Due to some works which are very prioritized in the office, i cannot able to do entire thing. So please consider this as my assignment. I'm sure ill perform well in the interviews, if I'm moved to the next rounds. Please consider my candidature.
